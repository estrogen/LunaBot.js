# Overview

Luna is the bot used to manage the kingdoms warframe server. One of the biggest warframe clans which contains over 5,000 in game players. The bot handles everything such as each staff teams shop and wallets, staff team applications, clan applications, moderation, and much much more. The team has decided that itd be better if we had a public directory for the project which will allow for user contributions, but also transparency among the community aswell. This project might not be the best code base due to this basically being my learning project to nodejs but I hope this project will continue to flourish.
